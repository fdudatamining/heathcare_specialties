# Heathcare Specialties

## Description
Our analysis brought us in a number of different directions that we are still pursuing. We're uploading some of our work in progress in the form of IPython Notebooks but plan on annotating the analysis and incorporating some of the techniques and visualizations into our framework.

Each notebook is preceeded by date it was created and a brief (and potentially misleading) title describing the contents.
